# Annotations Sketch Plugin

This is a [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) plugin for hiding/showing annotations on a functional specifications document. It toggles the visibility of all layer groups named `Annotations`. It runs on all pages and artboards of the open document.

It's useful when you use a same Sketch document for exporting:

- Images – _with_ annotations
- Prototypes – _without_ annotations
